# Strengths

  1. I am incredibly passionate about music and I use that passion to fuel my work ethic in other parts of my life.

  2. I'm excellent at managing myself and others. I learned this skill with years of teaching experience and sharing my love of music with others.

  3. I look forward to a challenge and I'm best at just 'making it up as i go'. I took a backpacking trip across Norway, Germany, and The Czech Republic to prove to myself that I could just 'figure it out'.
